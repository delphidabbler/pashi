# PasHi config file template
# --------------------------
#
# PURPOSE
# -------
#
# PasHi looks for a file named "config" in the %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\PasHi
# directory when it starts up. Any commands it finds in that file are used to
# override the program's defaults. No "config" file is provided as standard: the
# user must provide one if needed.
#
# This file is provided as a template for creating a "config" file. As supplied,
# this file makes makes no changes to PasHi's default state. However it is fully
# commented and lists every available configuration option.
#
# FILE FORMAT
# -----------
#
# Each command must be placed on its own line. Any parameters required by the
# command must follow the command and be separated from it by one or more
# spaces. Parameters containing spaces must not be enclosed in quotes.
#
# Commands must begin with a alphabetic character or a digit and can contain
# only aplphabetic characters, digits or hyphens (minus sign).
#
# Blank lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with #. Leading and trailing
# spaces and tabs are also ignored.
#
# The file must be saved in UTF-8 encoding, with or without BOM (byte order
# mark).
#
# WARNING: Errors in this file will crash PasHi. The program can usually work
# out if an error was caused by this file and will report the fact in its error
# message.
#
# USAGE
# -----
#
# To use this file you must copy it as "config", over-writing any existing file.
# "config" must be placed in the %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\PasHi directory.
#
# WARNING: Any changes to this file before renaming are likely to be overwritten
# by PasHi, so do not run PasHi while editing the original file. Preferrably you
# should make changes to a copy of this file.
#
# Commands entered on PasHi's command line override commands in this file.
#
# VALID COMMANDS
# --------------
#
# Only the commands listed below are valid. Each command is a simile of a long
# form command line command, except that the "--" prefix is omitted.
#
# For example the "doc-type" config command is a simile of the "--doc-type"
# command line command.
#
# Short form command line commands are not permitted.
#
# Not all command line commands may be used here. Certain commands that would
# cause PasHi to fail permanently are "blacklisted" and not permitted in the
# config file. If such a command is present then PasHi will fail with an error
# message.
#
# At present there is only one blacklisted command: "help"
