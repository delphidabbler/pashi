PasHi - Pascal Syntax Highlighter
=================================

Overview
--------

PasHi is a Pascal syntax highlighter targetted at the Delphi Language.

PasHi itself is a command line program. It has a help screen that can displayed from the command line by doing:

    > PasHi --help

For users who prefer to use a GUI, PasHi's installer provides the option to install PasHiGUI. This program provides GUI access to many (but not all) of PasHi's features.

For full details of how to install PasHi etc. see the file `ReadMe.txt` that is included in the program download.

A comprehensive user guide, [`UserGuide.html`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/delphidabbler/pashi/blob/master/Docs/UserGuide.html) is installed alongside PasHi. PasHiGUI provides a menu option to display the file.

> **Note:** Both `ReadMe.txt` and `UserGuide.html` can also be found in the `Docs` directory in PasHi's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/delphidabbler/pashi).

Source Code
-----------

PasHi's source code is hosted on GitHub as part of the [delphidabbler/pashi](https://github.com/delphidabbler/pashi) project.

> **Note:** Up to and including release 2.0 beta 2 the project's source code was maintained in a Subversion repository on GoogleCode. That repo was later converted to Git and imported to GitHub. Consequently all changes up to release 2.0 beta 2 were made to `master`. Some later changes, up to and including the creation of this ReadMe file were also committed to directly to `master`.

The [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) methodology has now been adopted. This means that all development work is now done on the `develop` branch or special `feature` branches off it, leaving `master` in a production ready state.

----------

The program's change log is recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` in the root directory of the GitHub project. The change log is not included in the program installation.

-------
