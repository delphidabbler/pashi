<h1>
	PasH Build Instructions
</h1>

<h2>
	Introduction
</h2>

<p>
	<em>PasH</em> is written in Object Pascal and is targeted at Delphi
	7. The Delphi IDE can be used to modify the source and to perform test
	builds. Final builds should be built using the provided Makefile, but you
	can get away with using the IDE if you don't change any resources.
</p>

<p>
	These notes apply only to source code of releases <strong>after and not
	including</strong> <em>PasH</em> v1.0.0. For any earlier version please see
	the file named <code>ReadMe-Src.txt</code> that will be in either the root
	directory or the <code>Docs</code> sub-directory of the source code
	distribution or repository.
</p>

<h2>
	Dependencies
</h2>

<p>
	The following library is required to compile <em>PasH</em>:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt class="spaced">
		Stream Extension Classes by DelphiDabbler
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Used to provide code for wrapping streams and providing extra
		functionality. The code is available from
		<a
			href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/streams"
		>http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/streams</a>. v2.0.1 or later is
		required.
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>
	You should download this DelphiDabbler code library and install it into a
	package or at least ensure that the compiled <code>.dcu</code> files are all
	in the same folder. It's easiest to use the Delphi IDE to do this.
</p>

<p>
	Set the <code>DELPHIDABLIB</code> environment variable to the folder where
	you placed the compiled library code.
</p>

<h3>
	Delphi VCL
</h3>

<p>
	You need the Delphi VCL in order to compile <em>PasH</em>.
</p>

<h2>
	Build Tools
</h2>

<p>
	The following tools are required to build <em>PasH</em>.
</p>

<h3>
	Delphi
</h3>

<p>
	A copy of Delphi is required to build the object Pascal code. Delphi 7
	is preferred. Delphi 2005 to  2008 should be able to compile the source.
	Delphi 2009 and later may work, but the code hasn't been written with Delphi
	2009's Unicode support in mind, so there may be problems. Delphis earlier
	than version 7 are likely to fail to compile <em>PasH</em>, but this hasn't
	been tested.
</p>

<p>
	You can use the Delphi IDE to edit the code and test compile it. The
	makefile requires the following command line tools:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt class="spaced">
		<code>DCC32</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		The Delphi command line compiler.
	</dd>
	<dt class="spaced">
		<code>BRCC32</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		The Borland resource compiler. Used to compile various source
		(<code>.rc</code>) files.
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>
	The following environment variables are associated with these tools:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt class="spaced">
		<code>DELPHIROOT</code> - required unless <code>DELPH7</code> is set.
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Should be set to the install directory of the version of Delphi being
		used. <code>DCC32</code> and <code>BRCC32</code> are expected to be in
		the <code>Bin</code> sub-directory of <code>DELPHIROOT</code>.
	</dd>
	<dt class="spaced">
		<code>DELPHI7</code> - optional
	</dt>
	<dd>
		If you are using Delphi 7 this environment variable should be set
		to the Delphi install directory. When specified <code>DELPHIROOT</code>
		will ignore its own value and use the value of <code>DELPHI7</code>
		instead.
	</dd>
	<dt class="spaced">
		<code>DELPHIDABLIB</code> - required unless <code>DELPHIDABLIB7</code>
		is set.
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Should be set to the directory where the compiler can find the required
		DelphiDabbler library compiled units. The code in this directory must
		have been compiled with the same version of Delphi used to compile
		<em>PasH</em>.
	</dd>
	<dt class="spaced">
		<code>DELPHIDABLIB7</code> - optional
	</dt>
	<dd>
		If you are using Delphi 7 this enviroment variable may be set to
		the install directory of the library code described above. When set the
		value of this variable is used by <code>DELPHIDABLIB</code> regardless
		of its own value.
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3>
	Borland MAKE
</h3>

<p>
	This is the make tool that ships with Delphi. You can use any version that
	works. 
</p>

<h3>
	DelphiDabbler Version Information Editor (VIEd)
</h3>

<p>
	This tool is used to compile version information (<code>.vi</code>) files
	into intermediate resource source (<code>.rc</code>) files. Version 2.11.2
	or later is required. Version Information Editor can be obtained from
	<a
		href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/vied"
	>http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/vied</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
	specified by the <code>VIEDROOT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h3>
	Zip
</h3>

<p>
	This program is used to create <em>PasH</em>' release file. 
	You can get a Windows command line version at
	<a
		href="http://stahlforce.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip"
	>http://stahlforce.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
	specified by the <code>ZIPROOT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h2>
	Preparation
</h2>

<h3>
	Configure the environment.
</h3>

<p>
	The first step is to configure the required environment variables.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<code>DELPHIROOT</code> or <code>DELPHI7ROOT</code>
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>DELPHIDABLIB</code> or <code>DELPHIDABLIB7</code>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Set any of the optional environment variables that are needed to specify the
	path to any tools that are not on the system path.
</p>

<p>
	You can configure environment variables either by modifying your system
	environment variables or by creating a batch file that you run before
	performing the build.
</p>

<h3>
	Get the Source Code
</h3>

<p>
	If you don't already have it, download the <em>PasH</em> source code. 
	How to go about that is explained at
	<a
		href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/pash/download"
	>http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/pash/download</a>. If necessary,
	extract the source code into a folder, preserving the directory structure.
</p>

<h3>
	Configure the Source Tree
</h3>

<p>
	After checking out or downloading and extracting the source code you should
	have the following directory structure:
</p>

<pre>./
  |
  +-- Docs                  - documentation
  |
  +-- Src                   - source code
  |   |
  |   +-- Assets            - various assets required to build resources
  |     
  +-- Test                  - contains test file</pre>
  
<p>
	If, by chance you also have a <code>Bin</code>, <code>Exe</code> and
	<code>Release</code> directory don't worry - all will become clear. 
	Subversion users will also see the usual <code>.svn</code> hidden
	directories. If you have done some editing you may also see occasional
	hidden <code>__history</code> folders, depending on which version of Delphi
	you are using.
</p>

<p>
	Before you can get hacking, you need to prepare the code tree. Open a
	command console and navigate into the <code>Src</code> sub-folder. Run any
	script you have created to set the required environment variables then do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make config</pre>

<p>
	You may need to replace <code>Make</code> with the full path to
	<code>Make</code> if it isn't on the path, or if the <code>Make</code> that
	runs isn't the Borland / CodeGear version. If this is the case try:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> %DELPHIROOT%\Bin\Make config</pre>

<p>
	or
</p>
  
<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> %DELPHI7%\Bin\Make config</pre>

<p>
	depending on which environment variable you have set.
</p>

<p>
	Once <code>Make config</code> has completed your folder structure should
	have acquired the following new folders:
</p>

<pre>./
  |
  +-- Bin                   - receives object files and .res files 
  |
  ...
  |
  +-- Exe                   - receives executable code
  |
  +-- Release               - receives release files
  |
  ...</pre>

<p>
	If the <code>Bin</code>, <code>Exe</code> and <code>Release</code> folders 
	already existed they will have been emptied. In addition, <code>Make</code>
	will have created <code>.cfg</code> and <code>.dof</code> files from
	templates in the <code>Src</code> folder. <code>.cfg</code> files are needed
	for DCC32 to run correctly and <code>.dof</code> files enable the use of the
	Delphi IDE. These files will be ignored by Subversion.
</p>
  
<p>
	If you are intending to use the Delphi IDE to compile code, you should also
	do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources</pre>

<p>
	This compiles the resource files that the IDE needs to link into compiled
	executables.
</p>

<p>
	You are now ready to build the source.
</p>

<h2>
	Building PasH
</h2>

<p>
	You have several options:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Build the <em>PasH</em> Executable
	</li>
	<li>
		Build the Release Zip File.
	</li>
	<li>
		Build and Release Everything.
	</li>
	<li>
		Clean Up.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Each of these options is described below. All except the last assume that
	<code>Make config</code> has been run.
</p>

<h3>
	Build the PasH Executable
</h3>

<p>
	This is the most common build and is achieved by using the following
	commands:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make pascal</pre>
 
<p>
	<code>PasH.exe</code> will be generated and placed in the
	<code>Exe</code> folder.
</p>

<h3>
	Build the Release Zip File
</h3>

<p>
	Once the setup file has been created you can create a zip file containing
	the setup file along with required documentation from the <code>Docs</code>
	directory. If either file is missing the release fails. Build the release by
	doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make release</pre>

<p>
	By default the release file is called <code>dd-PasH.zip</code>. You can
	change this name by defining the <code>RELEASEFILENAME</code> macro or
	enviroment variable. For example, you can name the file
	<code>MyRelease.zip</code> by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make -DRELEASEFILENAME=MyRelease release</pre>

<h3>
	Build and Release Everything
</h3>

<p>
	You can do a clean build of everything, and generate the release zip file
	simply by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make</pre>

<p>
	without specifying a target. This is the equivalent of:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make config
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make pascal
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make release</pre>

<h3>
	Clean Up
</h3>

<p>
	Various temporary files and directories are created by the IDE. These can be
	deleted by running:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make clean</pre>

<p>
	Be warned though that this command removes any <code>__history</code>
	folders that some versions of Delphi use to maintain earlier versions of
	files. 
</p>

<h2>
	Copyright

<p>
	If you are planning to re-use or modify any of the code, please see the file
	<code>SourceCodeLicenses.txt</code> in the <code>Docs</code> directory for
	an overview of the open source licenses that apply to the <em>PasH</em>
	source code.
